Question 1) Rearrange the Digits

Given a number N, find the smallest number which can be obtained by rearranging the digits of N. The generated number should not have any leading zeroes.

Example 1:

Input: N = 846903
Output:304689

Example 2:

Input: N = 55010
Output:10055

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function smallestnum() which takes N (represented by a string) as input parameter and returns a string representing the smallest possible rearrangement.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 101000


#SOLUTION C++


class Solution
{
public:
    string smallestnum(string N)
    {
        //code here
        int len =N.length();
        sort(N.begin(),N.end());
        int i=0;
        while(N[i]=='0')
             i++;
        swap(N[0],N[i]);
        return N;
    }
};
